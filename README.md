# RasPi
Python scripts and some other software for the raspberry pi lamp I'm working on. 

The hardware server 'fcserver-rpi' and the open pixel controler opc.py are part of FadeCandy's software around here https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy.git

The rest of the scripts are patterns for the lamp. As you will soon discover I save up all my programming elegance and efficency for my work, and write this code to relax, so don't judge me ;)

Feel fre to contribute with whatever idea you wish.
